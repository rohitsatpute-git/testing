          <h6>What are the delivery charges?</h6>
          <p>
            Delivery charge varies with each Seller. Sellers incur relatively
            higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a
            nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please
            check your order summary to understand the delivery charges for
            individual products.For Products listed as F-Assured a Rs 40 charge
            for delivery per item is applied if the order value is less than Rs
            500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are delivered free.
          </p>

          <h6>
            Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline
            of X-Y business days?
          </h6>
          <p>
            It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a
            holiday between the day your placed your order and the date of
            delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page.
            In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier
            partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in
            to the delivery dates.
          </p>

            Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi etc) on items sold by
            Sellers on Flipkar
          </h6>

          <p>
            There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on Apneehatti.
            List prices are final and all-inclusive. The price you see on the
            product page is exactly what you would pay. Delivery charges are not
            hidden charges and are charged (if at all) extra depending on the
            Seller's shipping policy.

          <h6>Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?</h6>
          <p>
            You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for
            sellers of the product you are interested in. Delivery times are
            influenced by product availability, geographic location of the
            Seller, your shipping destination and the courier partner's
            time-to-deliver in your location. Please enter your default pin code
            on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time)
            to know more accurate delivery times on the product page itself.
